# Task -3
# LGMVIP---DataScience-Global-terrorisM

This project is based on the Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Terrorism. I have used various kinds of basic plots like Matplotlib and Seaborn to give an initial look of the data.

# Project Title : Global Terrorism 

This repository presents Global Terrorism Dataset Exploratory data analysis.
With the help of this project we can see some useful insights and make decisions.

# Introduction

The scope of this project is to drill down the terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2015

The primary objectives are...

To identify and highlight the geographical and temporal patterns of the terrorism,
To discover the main parameters of a successful terrorist attack, and
To allow the user to customize the analysis and to explore the data in the most interactive way.
** The idea behind the project is to find out how the terrorism has developed in the Western world and whether we need to build tall walls to protect ourself against future threats. We chose our topic to be more global oriented, because It enables aggregation on many geographical levels including the globe, regions, countries, states, and cities It is very diversified and encapsulates many interesting attributes It has both temporal and geographical data

# Project Goal
This project is based on Global Terrorism Exploratory Data Analysis to get insights about the Most attacked country, region , year and many more things** The data here i used is taken from LGMVIP Internship and the data is from since 1970 to 2015.

# ‚è≥ Dataset
